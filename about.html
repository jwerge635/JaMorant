<p style="color:black;">Captain James Cook was successful in reaching various islands and land masses such as; Tierra del Fuego, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia, the Tongan islands and Antarctica.  Cook took particular interest in certain islands like New Zealand and Hawaii to interact with natives to learn more about their lifestyles while trying to get the Natives to do the same to his own.  Cook gave much effort to install British law, manner, and trade within the native peoples.  He thought the natives to be savages, cannibals, and ill-mannered thus giving him the need to bring these islands and people to British colonization.  It is said that, “Cook paved the way for english-speaking peoples to occupy the south-west pacific.” (pg 91)  Although Cook was viewed by others and indiginenous people to be a nasty tyrant he accelerated the timelines of those islands by allowing for future british and other europeans to settle and build trade and modernize civilization within.

<p style="color:blue;"> As previously stated, one of Cook’s main goals of the expedition was to locate the proclaimed southern continent.  This search sent Cook and his crew all over the pacific in hopes to find the continent.  They ended up making it pretty far south where it got very cold, they saw some land spots here and there but made the decision to go back, because even if this was the Great Southern Continent it would be way too cold to inhabit anyways.  What they didn’t know at the time or officially discovered was Antarctica, “the ice island we fell in with in the morning, for there were more than one, were very high and rugged terminating in many peaks, whereas all those we have seen before were quite flat at top and not so high.” (pg 147)  This gave affirmation to Britain and those who it concerned that the Great Southern Continent was a hoax but Cook was still able to provide valuable information in return.

<p style="color:black;"> Cook set out for his voyages with certain achievements in mind, while he may not have completed his original ones, he made up for it by gathering other useful information and knowledge.  Captain Cook came across the beloved islands we know today as Hawaii, however his interactions with them were not quite what he anticipated, he was able to learn from them and gather descriptions of pacific island lifestyle.  He did the same with other islands like New Zealand and others.  What made Cook’s explorations so important at the time was the fact that he was able to charter these islands and part of Australia to give an accurate location of where these are for map purposes.  Obviously this was very important for the world and somewhat complete the world’s depiction in terms of location on maps.  Cook also helped efforts in Nautical navigation by observing the transit of venus in Tahiti.
