<p style="color:darkgreen;">The basis of Cook’s career started when he got his apprenticeship in Whitby where he was able to go on a few small voyages while studying sea exploration, navigation, and cartography.  After enlisting in the Royal Navy in preparation for the Seven years war, he made a name for himself achieving the title Master’s Mate, and later while in Canada received a mastership of the HMS Northumberland.  This paved the way for Cook and his plans with exploration, in search for the great unknown southern continent in the name of the King of Britain.

<p style="color:darkgreen;"> Throughout Cook’s three voyages he explored and discovered to great lengths finding places and things of interest while failing to find the great southern continent.  However if Cook didn’t expand his search for this continent he would not have found half of the things he discovered nor would society be the same in those areas.  The discoveries of Captain Cook led to many economic opportunities and knowledgeable understanding of the world for not only Britain but the islands he touched and the world we know today.

<p style="color:darkgreen;"> Captain James Cook prepared himself in his early years for sea exploration being able to navigate and charter water unknown.  His successful run in the military is what gave him early fame and jump started his voyages.  Britain gave Cook various tasks spread throughout his voyages hoping for him to give answers to questions that were desperately needed.  Cook was successful in giving answers to these questions whether they were good or bad.  He accurately charted various islands that were needed on maps, while also laying a path down for colonization in the pacific.  Cook has done and is known for doing many bad things to Natives, however if not for his voyages and encounters the world would be behind as we know it.
