<p style="color:white;">The various maps given to observe show a variety of new techniques and developments in mapmaking at that point in time in the eighteenth century.  Even the slightest of modifications helps the curious world that surrounds us to better understand geographic position and relativity in certain area’s.  Along with this new map knowledge in the eighteenth century came a somewhat accurate depiction of distance in the pertained units.  This knowledge of distance between two locations stems from the concept of triangulation that is seen in the eighteenth century maps of France.

<p style="color:orange;"> The use of triangulation is a very unique but simple concept that was implemented into these maps.  As mentioned, they served the purpose of finding relative distance between certain location points.  The process of triangulation is done when you have the location of two points and you know the distance between those two points you can then use that information to find a third unknown point forming a somewhat symmetrical triangle given the equal length distance.  I thought this concept was very influential for map makers in that time period because by using triangulation you could find location points from any starting point.  This helped people of the time to have a more descriptive and accurate map.  This helped modernize maps used in today's world by the average person to find locations and distance.

<p style="color:white;"> On the other hand we have the Cassini Map which is composed of roughly 170 maps.  Instantly when seeing these maps you are a bit more excited than viewing the “Table Alphabetique de Villes”.  These maps show more geographical information like mountains, forests,  bodies of water, etc..  The detail seen in these maps is extraordinary having the mountain’s drawn in a realistic view along with the tree’s which in this version of these maps were colored in along with other areas.  The river’s show characteristics of their path and features serving a depiction to the viewer that is more realistic.  While some of the maps look a bit empty while others do not, this is because the map makers only put down what they know from their discoveries through exploration.  However, for the knowledge they had of the world at the time these maps served wonders to not just map viewers but civilization as a whole with new and exciting techniques.
